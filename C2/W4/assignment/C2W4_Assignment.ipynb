    "\n",
    "You have two options to solve this function. \n",

    "   - 1. One is to use `csv.reader` and create a for loop that reads from it, if you take this approach take this into consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `csv.reader` returns an iterable that returns a row of the csv file in each iteration.\n",
    "    Following this convention, row[0] has the label and row[1:] has the 784 pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - To reshape the arrays (going from 784 to 28x28), you can use functions such as [`np.array_split`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array_split.html) or [`np.reshape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - For type conversion of the numpy arrays, use the method [`np.ndarray.astype`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 2. The other one is to use `np.loadtxt`. You can find the documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Regardless of the method you chose, your function should finish its execution in under 1 minute. If you see that your function is taking a long time to run, try changing your implementation."
