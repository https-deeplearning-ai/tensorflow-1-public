    "\n",
    "In Course 1 of this specialization, you saw how to use a CNN to make your recognition of computer generated images of horses and humans more efficient. In this lesson, you'll take that to the next level: building a model to classify real images of cats and dogs. Like the horses and humans dataset, real-world images also come in different shapes, aspect ratios, etc. and you will need to take this into account when preparing your data.\n",

    "In this lab, you will first review how to build CNNs, prepare your data with `ImageDataGenerator` and examine your results. You'll follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Explore the example data of `Dogs vs. Cats`\n",
    "2.   Build and train a neural network to classify between the two pets\n",

    "Since you have a relatively small number of training examples (2000), overfitting should be the number one concern. Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n",
