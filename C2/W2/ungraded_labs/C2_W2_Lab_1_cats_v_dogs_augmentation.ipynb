    "# Ungraded Lab: Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons, you saw that having a high training accuracy does not automatically mean having a good predictive model. It can still perform poorly on new data because it has overfit to the training set. In this lab, you will see how to avoid that using _data augmentation_. This increases the amount of training data by modifying the existing training data's properties. For example, in image data, you can apply different preprocessing techniques such as rotate, flip, shear, or zoom on your existing images so you can simulate other data that the model should also learn from. This way, the model would see more variety in the images during training so it will infer better on new, previously unseen data.\n",

The code is basically the same from the previous lab so we won't go over the details step by step since you've already seen it before.\n",
