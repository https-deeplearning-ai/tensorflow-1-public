    "In this exercise you'll build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that house pricing is as easy as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc."

    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",

    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",

In this case, the number of bedrooms will be the features, which the network will try to map to the target of the prices. **These tensors (or numpy arrays) should have six elements which will be the values (number of bedrooms and price in hundreds of thousands) for houses with 1 up to 6 bedrooms**. \n",
