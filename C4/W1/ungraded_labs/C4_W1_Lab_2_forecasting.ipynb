    "* Trailing windows - This refers to getting the mean of past values to smooth out the value at the current time step. For example, getting the average of `t=0` to `t=6` to get the smoothed data point at **`t=6`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centered windows - This refers to getting the mean of past *and future* values to smooth out the value at the current time step. For example, getting the average of `t=0` to `t=6` to get the smoothed data point at **`t=3`**.\n",

To get the smooth data point at `t=1000` (i.e. start of the validation set), it will average the measurements at `t=995` to `t=1005`."
